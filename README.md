### About Chroma
Chroma is a powerful vector-based database. It provides collections and official [instruments](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/collections/manage-collections) to work with them directly in Python or Typescript. Now you can write simple instructions and do not care about embedding generation. Our tool will parse your code and automatically execute all necessary commands for you to make Chroma usage as simple as possible ‚ò∫Ô∏è

### Collections üìö
Chroma Collections are like folders that store *embeddings*, which are special representations of data (like text or images) turned into numerical form so you can search, filter, and analyse them smartly.

### What You Can Do?
You can work with files inside the collection with all possible Chroma instruments and even more ü§© So you can:
- Add files with given name (content) and optional metadata;
- Get the concrete file content by its ID;
- Update the file content and metadata;
- Search for the nearest files with respect to their content;
- Delete the file;
- Drop the whole collection;
You should use a semicolon `;` at the end of every command
